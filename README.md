# VTLBioreactor Modeling
This project is the modeling of a Vertical Tubular Loop Bioreactor (VTLB) for Polyhydroxybutirate production.

Abstract of the work:

This work proposed to reproduce the modeling of a vertical tubular external loop bioreactor (VTLB) to growth biomass and estimate a Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) production from natural gas. The modelling considered three different parts of the VTLB, the riser, the gas-separator and the dowcomer sections, each one with singular geometry. The gas hold-up property was also analyzed for each section, observing his importance for the components consumption. The biomass growth kinetic used the Monod equation with inhibition for oxygen and methane, some simplification was made for the material balance and the reactor was considered adiabatic. The results obtained corroborates with the literature and indicates an expected behavior, showing the methane consumption similar for all section, and a decrease of the oxygen disposable from the riser to the dowcomer section. The reactor presented a final estimated PHB production of 5.18 grams in 40 hours for a reactor of one liter. The biomass concentration increased from 0.1 mg/L to 5 mg/L, and the methane was reduced from 10 mg/L to 4 mg/L. These results indicates the possibility to explore the VTLB as an interesting option to produce PHB from natural gas. Future researches can focus on thermal modeling and experimental validation.
